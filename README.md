# SciComp-2017
Contains materials for final project for Scientific Computing for Biologists (Winter 2017)

My project is composeR, an R function that reads in a Nexus data file and outputs a csv file.

Scripts contains the actual R scripts.  Note: composeR is the version for submission; composeR_adv is a currently nonfunctional, more complicated version.

Markdowns contains two explanatory markdown documents, one for composeR and another for composeR_adv.

Data contains the Nexus file used in the development of composeR.  It is the Nexus data file from the supplementary information of Zhu et al. 2016 in their description of Qilinyu (see http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6310/334).
